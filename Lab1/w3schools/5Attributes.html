<h2>The href Attribute</h2>
<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>


<h2>The src Attribute</h2>
<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">


<h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
<p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image get an understanding of what the image contains:</p>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket" width="500" height="600">


<img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
<p>If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead. </p>


<h2>The style Attribute</h2>
<p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>
<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

<h1>About W3Schools</h1>

<p title=Description of W3Schools>
You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value 
if the value contains spaces.
</p>
<p><b>
If you move the mouse over the paragraph above,
your browser will only display the first word from the title.
</b></p>

<h2>Single or Double Quotes?</h2>
<p>In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the paragraphs below to see the effect:</p>
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>John with double quotes</p>
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">John with single quotes</p>
